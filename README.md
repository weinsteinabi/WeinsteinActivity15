# STAT 184 - Activity #15

## Creating a GitHub Repository for Activity #14

The repository supplements the tasks from Activity #14 for STAT 184, which involves creating a .QMD file documenting changes and visualizations for a variety of previous assignments. The goals of this activity are to allow students to practice revising and improving code, developing narrative text, and working with GitHub. These are all skills that will be implemented in the Course Project at the end of the semester.

#### Activity #14 Tasks

Activity #14 has four tasks necessary to be implemented. These involve reapplying skills learned throughout the semester and improving prior work, as well as reflecting on the course as a whole.

-   **Task 1**: Wrangling U.S. Armed Forces Data (Activities #8 and #10)

-   **Task 2**: Generating Baby Names Line Plot (Activity #13)

-   **Task 3:** Generating Plots Based on Functions (Activity #4)

-   **Task 4:** Course Reflection

These tasks are described in more detail within the output - hyperlink (.PDF) document and .QMD - hyperlink file supplied within the repository.

## Data Sources

The first two tasks of Activity #14 required external data sources.

**Task 1 Data:** We utilized two data frames for this task, U.S. Armed Forces Data and Rank-Pay Grade data. Both sources are linked below:

-   [Rank - Pay Grade Data (Neil J. Hatfield)](https://neilhatfield.github.io/Stat184_PayGradeRanks.html)

-   [U.S. Armed Forces Data (DMDC)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cn4i0-ymB1ZytWXCwsJiq6fZ9PhGLUvbMBHlzqG4bwo)

**Task 2 Data**: This task utilized the BabyNames data set from the {dcData} package in R. This is a supplementary package that coincides with the textbook "Data Computing (2nd Edition)" by Kaplan and Beckman.

Citations for each data set can be found at the end of this file, [here] (#citations).

## Project Planning

The documentation for the current plan can be found in the "Activity15Plan" document [here]. Within this document, goals and procedures for both repository and report development are recorded.

At the current moment, this repository is undergoing the editing phase. All documents are being reviewed and polished as needed.

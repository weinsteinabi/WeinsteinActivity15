This document details the plan for both 1) managing of the GitHub repository for 
Activity #15 and 2) producing the final QMD file for Activity #15. 

Task 1 - Manage GitHub Repository
GOAL: Create a public, working GitHub repository using files from Activity #14
NEEDS: GitHub Desktop, RStudio, Activity #14 QMD file, Activity #15 repository
STEPS:
1) Create "WeinsteinActivity15" repository on desktop
2) Open a developer branch
3) Open in R
4) Add all necessary files to R environment
  a. README
  b. Planning document
  c. QMD file
  d. Output document
5) Commit inital documents to developer branch devWeinstein
6) Conduct any necessary edits to QMD file and render to pdf
  **Note: already pre-created, otherwise would be later step**
7) Commit QMD and PDF changes to devWeinstein
8) Update/write up planning document 
  a. Record steps of the QMD file
  b. Record GitHub management steps
9) Commit update to devWeinstein
10) Generate an appropriate README file
  a. Include descriptions of data sources, repo organization, etc. 
11) Commit update to devWeinstein
12) Push to main branch
13) Public repository to GitHub
14) Check over documentation and update as needed

TASK 2 - Create QMD File
GOALS: Create a report documenting updated code for three separate assignments 
in a QMD file, rendered as a PDF
NEEDS: RStudio, Quarto, BabyNames Data, US Armed Forces Data, Rank-PayGrade Data, 
{tidyverse, ggplot2, dpylr, rvest, googlesheets4, knitr, kableExtra, scales}
STEPS: 
1) Open a R QMD file
2) Set up document in YAML header
  a. Include name, date, title, output format, etc. 
  b. Include an abstract to introduce document
  c. Include table of contents
3) Begin Task 1 - Activity #8 and #10 redo
  a. Briefly describe task and process (USAF frequency table + wrangling)
  b. Import USAF and Rank-Pay data and packages
  c. Clean data and merge
  d. Subset data to include one branch and one pay group
  e. Generate frequency table 
  f. Produce narrative text describing the visualization 
4) Begin Task 2 - Activity #13 redo
  a. Briefly describe task and process (Baby Name subset line plot)
  b. Import BabyNames data and packages
  c. Subset data 
  d. Generate line plot
  f. Produce narrative text describing the visualization
5) Begin Task 3 - Activity #4 expansion
  a. Briefly describe task and process (modify volume function + plot)
  b. Import packages
  c. Modify function to meet parameters provided
  d. Use stat_function to produce function plot
  e. Produce narrative text describing the visualization
6) Reflect on course material (Task 4)
7) Generate a code appendix, separated by section
8) Review and update as needed
